                            <p>You are required to obtain information on the nature and purpose of the proposed business
                                relationship with their
                                clients. It includes understanding what the client is trying to achieve, how much
                                business (volume and value) is
                                expected, and how regular their interactions will be.

                                ‘Nature’ refers to the client, products or services i.e. what the client is bringing to
                                the business relationship,
                                including expected volumes of business and how regular interactions might be.

                                <br>

                                ‘Purpose’ relates to the uses that the client intends to put the products/services to
                                i.e. why the client wants the
                                particular product or service and what they are using it for.

                                When loading deals on the AMLHub these questions are asked and recorded.</p>

                            <p>You will need to verify the company by obtaining the following information from the
                                Companies Office's <a href="http://www.business.govt.nz/companies">Website:</a></p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>full name of the company;</li>
                                <li>full address of the company’s registered office and principal place of business;
                                </li>
                                <li>registration number of the company;</li>
                                <li>names of the directors.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Additionally, you will need identify the beneficial owners of the company and then
                                onboard them to the same standard
                                as individuals/natural person clients. Refer to the FAQ on individuals/natural persons
                                or your Compliance Programme
                                for details on how to onboard individuals/natural persons.
                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>A beneficial owner is any individual (natural person) who satisfies one or more of the
                                elements below:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>the individual has effective control of the client;</li>
                                <li>the individual is a person on whose behalf a transaction is conducted;</li>
                                <li>the individual owns more than 25% of the client or person on whose behalf a
                                    transaction is conducted (e.g. direct/indirect shareholders).</li>

                            </ol>
                            <p>If there are no shareholders over 25%, you will need to onboard the directors and those
                                who exercise effective control over the company.

                            <p>From an ML/FT risk perspective charities (particularly overseas charities) are considered
                                high risk. However, certain
                                attributes can reduce risk, specifically:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>if the charity is registered in New Zealand; and</li>
                                <li>if the charity is well known and its charitable purpose is clear.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>Where a charity is a client/beneficial owner and therefore is subject to CDD
                                requirements, the following steps will need to be taken:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Search the charity on the following website to confirm that they are a registered NZ
                                    charity <a>https://register.charities.govt.nz/CharitiesRegister/Search</a></li>
                                <li>You will need to retain the evidence of registration on your client files.</li>
                                <li>Identification of the officers of the charity, whose details are listed on the
                                    charities website.</li>
                            </ol>


                            <p>In order identify the officers you will need to identify the name, date of birth and
                                address of each of the
                                individuals, as per the Code of Practice/your Compliance Programme. You will not always
                                need to identify all
                                officers, as some may not be deemed to necessarily have effective controls. Your
                                decisions in regards to effective
                                control will need to be documented on the client file.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                <p>Where a Charity is a trust structure, you will need to perform Enhanced CDD on them.
                                    However, this is often very
                                    simple as registered entities are required to upload their annual returns on the
                                    Charities’ <a href="https://www.charities.govt.nz/"> website.</a></p>
