                            <p>This question relates to the concept of ‘material change in the nature and purpose of the
                                business relationship’.

                                <br>
                                As with many other technical areas of AML/CFT in the context of real estate, this is
                                currently a ‘grey area’. The DIA has not yet drawn a line in the sand as to the
                                requirements for when such a situation occurs.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Reflecting on our experience from other sectors such as finance: generally where there
                                is a change to the terms of an agreement such as that of general listing converting to a
                                sole listing, it is deemed to be a material change. Therefore, customer due diligence
                                would need to be undertaken.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You would therefore from an AML/CFT perspective, treat the client as a ‘new client’ and
                                onboard them accordingly.</p>

                                What is effective control/an effective controller?
                                Effective control is the ability to exercise control or influence over a company or
                                entity.

                                Typically, an effective controller will be the directors of a company or entity or those
                                who hold senior positions. It
                                could also be those who are funding the company, so this is something else that you will
                                need to consider, and where
                                relevant, inquire about.

                            <p>Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who, through their position in public
                                life, may be vulnerable to corruption.

                                The definition of a PEP can be found in Section 5 of the Act and in your Compliance
                                Programme glossary. Specifically, a
                                Politically Exposed Person (PEP) is an individual who holds, or has held at any time in
                                the preceding 12 months in any
                                overseas country, certain prominent public functions. This includes heads of state or of
                                government, government
                                ministers, senior judicial or military officials, senior foreign representatives,
                                ambassadors or high commissioners,
                                senior executives of state/government owned enterprises and the Reserve Bank Governor
                                (or equivalent position).
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                The definition of PEP also includes any immediate family member of the individual
                                (spouse, partner, child, parent, etc.)
                                and certain known associates (having regard to publicly available information) of an
                                individual who is a PEP.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The New Zealand legislation currently limits this concept to foreign PEPs, and does not
                                include domestic PEPs i.e. those
                                who hold or have held public offices in New Zealand. While you should confirm with all
                                clients whether they are a PEP or
                                not, you will need to pay particular attention to those who have an obvious foreign
                                connection.</p>

                            <p>The Amended Identity Verification Code of Practice 2013 (IVCOP) sets out the combination
                                of documents you can use to
                                verify an individual clients or natural persons (for example a beneficial owner’s) name
                                and date of birth. This is also
                                included in Appendix 1 of your AML/CFT Compliance Programme.

                                There are many possible documents you can use but the most common for verifying name and
                                date of birth:
                                <ol>

                                    <li>A New Zealand Driver’s Licence in combination with a copy of the front and back
                                        of a credit card with the
                                        individuals name embossed on the credit card. You will need to ensure that the
                                        credit details are appropriately
                                        obscured to reduce any fraud risk.

                                This gives you some flexibility in the approach you take. However, be sure to take

                                reliable and independent source. Examples of how you may verify residential address:

                                ambassadors or high commissioners,
                                senior executives of state/government owned enterprises and the Reserve Bank Governor
                                (or equivalent position).
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                The definition of PEP also includes any immediate family member of the individual
                                (spouse, partner, child, parent, etc.)
                                and certain known associates (having regard to publicly available information) of an
                                individual who is a PEP.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                The New Zealand legislation currently limits this concept to foreign PEPs, and does not
                                include domestic PEPs i.e. those
                                who hold or have held public offices in New Zealand. While you should confirm with all
                                clients whether they are a PEP or
                                not, you will need to pay particular attention to those who have an obvious foreign
                                connection.
                                <br>
                                <br>

                                The following indicators, amongst others, are signs of an obvious foreign connection:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>the client provides foreign identity verification documents;</li>
                                    <li>the client provides foreign contact information (e.g. mailing address, phone
                                        number or email suffix);</li>
                                    <li>the client indicates that they have migrated to New Zealand within the last 12
                                        months.</li>
                                </ol>
                                You will need to screen any clients who you suspect might be a PEP, and should screen
                                any clients who have an obvious
                                foreign connection.

                                A PEP screen can be completed through the AMLHub website within the update individual
                                page.
