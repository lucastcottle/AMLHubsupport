                                with its criminal past. Once this has been achieved, criminals can introduce their dirty

                                undetected.

                            <p>Terrorist financing is the financial support of terrorists or those who encourage, plan
                                or engage in terrorism.

                                Terrorist financing may involve funds raised from legitimate sources, such as personal
                                donations and profits from
                                businesses and charitable organisations. It may also be drawn from criminal sources,
                                such as the drug trade, the
                                smuggling of weapons and other goods, fraud, kidnapping and extortion.

                                People who finance terrorism often use similar methods and tools to those used for money
                                laundering.

                                Any employee or contractor (for example admin staff and sales agents) of your agency can
                                verify identity documents, as
                                long as they have been appropriately trained to do so.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                You may also enter into contractual arrangements to allow third parties to do this on
                                your behalf. If you enter into
                                such an arrangement, your AML/CFT Compliance Programme will need to be updated
                                accordingly.

                                On the AMLHub we do this by uploading images via the application.

                                If not using the AMLHub app, we recommend putting in place the following stamp for staff
                                to utilise when verifying
                                documents manually (outside of the AMLHub application). The stamp would state:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>For photographic identification documents – “I verify that this is a true copy
                                        of the original document,
                                        which I
                                        have personally sighted; and the photograph is a true likeness.”
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        For all other identification documents – “I verify that this is a true copy of
                                        the original document, which
                                        I have
                                        personally sighted.”

                                    </li>
                                </ol>
                                You may choose not to have a stamp and instead hand write the above - this would be
                                acceptable.

                                Where the agency does not meet the customers face-to-face, certified copies will need to
                                be obtained for any ID
                                documentation collected for a customer. You should refer to the <strong><a
