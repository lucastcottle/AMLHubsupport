                            Click the "verify email" link found in the verification email sent to you, where from there

                            and establish a login for your user account. Following the creation of this login, your
                            status as a user will change
                            from "pending" to "active".<br><br>

                            If you cannot find this verification email in your primary inbox, please check your junk

                            with access to the users page of the AMLHub website can re-send this verification email to

                                Upon the creation of a deal in the app, sales agents are provided with the option to

                                Register section of our desktop support FAQs or our desktop manual for how to assign

                                <strong>Please note:</strong> anyone who wants to be able to edit the deal through the
                                app should be assigned to it (can be more than
                                one). All senior staff with access to the CDD Register on the AMLHub desktop are already
                                able to update any property
                                through the desktop without needing to be assigned to it. However, if they would like to
                                edit this property through
                                the app too, they will need to be assigned.
