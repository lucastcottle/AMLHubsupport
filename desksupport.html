                            Everyone is able to login to the AMLHub desktop (amlhub.co.nz) and the AMLHub app
                            (downloaded from either the App Store or the Google Play Store). However, users who have app
                            only access i.e. Salesperson (App Only) and Admin (App Only) will not be able to access any
                            feature of their entity on the desktop due to not being granted any permissions for this

                            a couple of these categories:
                            <ol>
                                <li><strong>25%+ ownership</strong>: this is where someone owns more than 25% of the
                                    asset, meaning they are a beneficial owner.</li>
                                <li><strong>Trustee</strong>: trustee of the trust. These are the named trustees in a
                                    Trust Deed. For example, for a family trust this would typically be the husband and
                                    wife, and their lawyer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Settlor</strong>: Settlor of the trust. This is the named Settlor in a Trust
                                    Deed</li>
                                <li><strong> Controller</strong>: someone who is in effective control of the asset i.e.
                                    Managing Director, who may also be a 25%+ shareholder.</li>
                                <li><strong>Acting on behalf</strong>: someone who is instructing you on behalf of the
                                    owner. This maybe a lawyer or power of attorney.</li>
                                <li><strong>Executor</strong>: the executor of the will.</li>

                            When assigning users to a property in Branch A, the drop down menu will be consistent with
                            Branch A users. If you then proceed to Branch B to assign users, however, and the drop down
                            menu from Branch A is being remembered instead, please see below.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            You can resolve this problem by refreshing your webpage, where the drop down menu will
                            change to be consistent with the branch you are in at the time of refreshing. For example,
                            once you access the CDD Register of Branch A, refreshing the page should subsequently bring
                            up a drop down menu consistent with the Branch A users.
